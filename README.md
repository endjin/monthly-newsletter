# Monthly Newsletter

The repository used to manage the monthly endjin newsletter

## Usage

Create a `YYYY/MM` folder and copy and paste `_template.md` to `content.md`.

For each contributor, create a feature branch and make your changes. Issue a PR for your content to be reviewed and merged into the main `content.md`. Content, once approved, will then be transferred into Campaign Monitor for distribution.
